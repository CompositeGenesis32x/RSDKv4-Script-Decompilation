	// NOTE:
	// This event exists in the bytecode, though its completely empty
	// This suggests that something either was here and got scrapped, leaving only the function
	// or that there was something like a #Platform: STANDARD check here that removed PC only code
	// this script decomp currently is based on MOBILE platform code, since that is the only code avaliable to the public at this point
